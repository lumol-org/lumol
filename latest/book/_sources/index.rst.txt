The Lumol user manual
=====================

.. note::

    Lumol is actively developed and should be considered as alpha software.

    As the code is likely to change so is this documentation.

Welcome to the Lumol user manual. In this book we teach you how to use Lumol to
set up and run classical molecular simulations. We designed Lumol to be
*flexible* and *extensible*; you are able to customize your simulation to suit
your needs and use it as a platform to implement your own algorithms and
customized potential functions in an *easy* way. You can use Lumol as a command
line tool as well as a library in your own code.

    This user manual is also available as a `PDF <Lumol.pdf>`_ file, if you
    prefer to have it available locally or printed.
